# Algorithm Repository

## Purpose of This Repository

The primary objective of creating this Algorithm repository is to enhance problem-solving skills and programming capabilities by tackling a variety of algorithmic challenges. The journey through these problems is not merely about improving technical skills; it's a strategic preparation to succeed in job interviews, particularly aiming for acceptance into the companies of our dreams. This repository serves as a testament to the hard work, dedication, and continuous learning required to achieve those career milestones.

## How to Use This Repository

### Folder Structure

To maintain consistency and ease of navigation, this repository adheres to a specific folder structure. Users are expected to follow this structure when adding new solutions to the repository. The structure is as follows:

platform (e.g., leetcode, codejam)/category (e.g., bfs, sliding_window)/problem_name+problem_number (optional)/problem_name+problem_number+your_name (e.g., summing_two_1359_Steven)/your_solution.extension (e.g., .java, .c, .py)

ex)  /leetcode/bfs/summing_two_1359_Steven/suming_two_1359_Steven.java, /leetcode/SlidingWindow/Summing_two_1359_Steven/Suming_two_1359_Steven.java

By organizing solutions in this manner, we ensure that the repository remains organized and that solutions can easily be found based on the problem's platform, category, and name.

### Providing Feedback

An integral part of learning and development is receiving and giving feedback. If you wish to provide feedback on a solution submitted by another developer, you can do so by creating a feedback file within the solution folder of that developer. The feedback file can be in any format (.txt, .java, etc.). This process not only fosters a collaborative learning environment but also encourages constructive criticism and peer learning.
